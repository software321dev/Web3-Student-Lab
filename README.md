**Web3 Student Lab** is an open-source educational platform that helps students learn blockchain,
smart contracts, open-source collaboration, and hackathon project development in one place.

The platform provides **interactive tools, coding environments, and guided learning paths** designed
for beginners and university students.

## 🟢 Live Deployment

The application is fully deployed and accessible online:
- **Frontend Application**: [https://web3-student-lab.vercel.app/](https://web3-student-lab.vercel.app/)
- **Backend Infrastructure**: Hosted securely on Render using PostgreSQL, Redis, and integrated with the Stellar/Soroban Testnet.

## 🚀 Core Modules

1. **Blockchain Learning Simulator**: Visually learn how blockchains work (create transactions, mine
   blocks, view hashes, and see how blocks connect).
2. **Smart Contract Playground**: Write, run, and test smart contracts directly in your browser.
   Focuses on Soroban contracts written in Rust.
3. **Web3 Learning Roadmap**: A guided path spanning programming fundamentals, cryptography,
   blockchain architecture, smart contracts, and full Web3 applications.
4. **Hackathon Project Idea Generator**: Overcome coder's block by generating ideas based on
   technology and sector preferences.
5. **Open Source Contribution Trainer**: Get hands-on with Git, simulated GitHub issues, and PR
   exercises to confidently contribute to open source.

## 🛠 Technology Stack

**Frontend**

- React / Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Monaco Editor

**Backend**

- Node.js / Express
- PostgreSQL

**Blockchain Integration**
